# GameAudioScriptingEssentials
 
***Game audio tools made by a sound designer/composer for sound designers/composers!***

The Game Audio Scripting Essentials package will help you along on your journey to implement audio in your games and projects, making it easy to do a few key features of middleware like FMOD and Wwise without the need for them.

## Core Features

- **Audio Randomizer Container** – scriptable object that allows the user to put multiple sound effect files into a single object, set settings for it, then when played it will randomly select and play one. Functionally, the middleware equivalents are FMOD’s multi-instrument shuffle and Wwise’s switch containers.

- **Adaptive Music Container** – script that adds fully functional adaptive music with ease to your project. This script allows you to change the volume of layers in different states, for example, adding a combat layer over an ambient layer, but also switch to different sections of pieces with different transitions. The layers utilize Audio Randomizer Containers as well, allowing you to have plenty of customization.

- **Sample Assets** – includes assets for an example scene, with music loops, both layers and different sections, and footsteps with a few variations. All these assets are free to use in commercial projects as well with credit (more information in the EULA).
  - Ambience, Lake waves - 2 files, 96kHz, 24bit, stereo, loopable, wav
  - Ambience, Porch thunderstorm - 2 files 96kHz, 24bit, stereo, loopable, wav
  - Footsteps, gravel - 10 files, 48kHz, 16bit, mono, wav
  - Music, Synthwave - 9 files, 48kHz, 24bit, stereo, loopable, wav

View technical details on the Unity Asset Store page for full asset list in detail. 

- **A Very Rough Character Controller** – included for the sake of showing the features in the example scene, but shows how easily this can be added to existing scripts.
